# Potato_Disease_Classification

## Ojective
Buiding a Convolution Neural Network to classify an image of potato plant into Early Blight, late Blight and Healthy Plant.


## Problem
There are a number of diseases to be aware of that could affect your potatoes. The main are as follow.
(1)Early Blight
(2)Late Blight

## Dataset
We had a kaggle dataset of potato plant images which has three categories:
(1)Early Blight, (2)Late Blight and (3)Healthy plant Images.

## Model building and Trainig
I have used Tensorflow to build and train a CNN to solve the problem.

## Result
Got an accuracy of 91% on test dataset.

## Deployment
Used flask to deploy on localhost.
